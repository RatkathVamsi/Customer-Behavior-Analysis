# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
E commerce sales and customer behavior analysis

This project was done as a required coursework for the class CSCI 5707: Principles of Database Management Systems at the University Of Minnesota.

I decided to upload this on github almost a year on from the completion of the course and hence I was not able to retrieve all the documents due to the expiration of the license used for Snowflake on which we performed data cleaning and initial exploring before implementing using PowerBI. However, the code snippets can still be found on the ppt and the report uploaded in the repository.

This was a group project and the credit is due for all the other members as well!!. To describe the project, we took a dataset from kaggle before we performed data cleaning {handling NAs, ensuring right format for some of the columns} on snowflake after which we moved to powerBI to generate the dashboards indicating the KPIs that we were interested in. The conceptual diagrams were included in the report as well

This project improved my practical understanding and application skills in SQL, Snowflake, PowerBI.
